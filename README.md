# Hackshow & Beers

"Hackshow & Beers" its a game created for me with canvas & javascript at Ironhack Bootcamp Web Development as proyect of first module.

The game is about a race vs differents TA'S & Teach Leader for win the axe which Ironhack gift if you are the best proyect of third module.

You can get the beers but musnt get code languages as js, node or react. Because the fridays on Ironhack at 18:00 are the Ironbeers! and is "prohibited programming".

Better get a cold beer and speak with your mates or see the proyects and.....

WAIT FOR HACKSHOW!!
